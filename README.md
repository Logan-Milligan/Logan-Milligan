- âš¡ Fun fact: i started coding at age 9 on a HP Pavilion A153n running Windows XP | i regularly switch between Windows, Linux, and macOS | my first laptop was a PowerMac G3
running MacOS 10 Leopard. My first experiences with modifying software was when i jailbroke my iphone 4S it sparked my interest in mobile device software.
